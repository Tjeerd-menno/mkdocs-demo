# Support Question Baseline

**Purpose**: Establish the pre-site baseline for SC-008 measurement.

**SC-008 target**: Documentation-related support questions decrease by at least 30%
after 3 months of operation compared to this baseline.

## Baseline measurement

**Period**: 3 months prior to v1.0.0 go-live
**Measurement date**: 2026-02-18 (before v1.0.0 tag)
**Measured by**: Replace with author name

### Data sources

Fill in counts from your team's actual support channels before tagging v1.0.0:

| Channel | Documentation-related questions (3-month count) |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| GitHub Issues (label: `question`) | 0 |
| Team Slack (`#product-questions`) | 0 |
| Email (support inbox) | 0 |
| **Total** | **0** |

> Update the table above with real counts before pushing the `v1.0.0` tag.
> "Documentation-related" = questions whose answer is already documented or should be documented.

## Post-launch check-in

At 3 months post-launch (target: **2026-05-18**), repeat the measurement and compare:

| Metric | Baseline | 3-month post-launch | Change |
|--------|----------|---------------------|--------|
| Doc-related support questions | _baseline total_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ |

**SC-008 pass threshold**: Post-launch count ≤ 70% of baseline (≥ 30% reduction).

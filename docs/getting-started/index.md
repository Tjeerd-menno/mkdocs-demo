# Getting Started

This section covers everything a new contributor or consumer needs to begin working with this documentation site.

## For documentation readers

- Use the **version selector** in the header to choose the release you are working with.
- Use the **search bar** (top right) to find content within the currently selected version.
- Cross-reference links in pages always stay within the same version.

## For documentation authors

- Follow the [Installation guide](installation.md) to set up your local preview environment.
- Read the [Quickstart guide](quickstart.md) for authoring rules: frontmatter, headings, relative links, and the OpenAPI YAML workflow.

# Internal Product Docs

Welcome to the internal engineering documentation site. This site is the single destination
for versioned product documentation and API reference — maintained by the engineering team
and published automatically on every product release.

## What you'll find here

- **[Getting Started](getting-started/index.md)** — Installation, quickstart guide, and authoring guide for documentation contributors.
- **[Concepts](concepts/index.md)** — The *why* behind key design decisions. Read this before diving into how-to guides.
- **[How-To Guides](how-to/index.md)** — Task-focused instructions for common engineering workflows.
- **[Reference](reference/api.md)** — Interactive API reference rendered from the committed OpenAPI specification.
- **[Release Notes](release-notes/index.md)** — Per-version changelog covering breaking changes, new features, and fixes.

## Version selector

Use the version selector in the header to switch between published releases. `latest` always points
to the most recently published stable release. `dev` reflects the current state of the `main` branch.
